      <description>"The Sparrow" - After 20 years, we revisit Mary Doria Russell’s first-contact classic “The Sparrow.” It’s a story about aliens, spirituality, and why God allows terrible things to happen to good people. And boy, do terrible things happen to people in this book. (Content advisory: One of those things is sexual assault of humans by aliens.) 

&lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Scott McNulty, Shannon Sudderth and Erika Ensign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"Sunset Boulevard" and "Stalag 17" - Old Movie Club returns with two classic films directed by Billy Wilder and starring William Holden: The darkly tragi-comic Hollywood story “Sunset Boulevard” and the dramati-comic World War II prisoner-of-war story “Stalag 17.” Monty pitches a “Sunset Boulevard” prequel featuring a butler and a chimp. We notice the similarities between “Stalag 17” and an enormous number of sitcoms and comedy films from the following 30 years.

But there are cameos by Erik Estrada and Vivica A. Fox! Anyway, our logic slides right off.

      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/306/index.php</link>
      <description>Professor Siracusa's Anime 103 - Professor Siracusa’s Anime class is back in session, as we watch two short films with similar themes, both by director Makoto Shinkai. First there’s “The Voices of a Distant Star,” which features a boy and a girl separated by light-years as she fights an alien scourge. Then there’s “5 Centimeters Per Second,” in which a boy and a girl are separated by… a long train journey. Both are beautiful explorations of teenage romantic angst and isolation, with images that will stick with our panelists for a long time.

      <description>The X-Men - We celebrate all of mutantkind with a broad discussion of Marvel’s Uncanny X-Men, especially the versions we grew up reading in comics.

And how well does this movie fit into the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe series as a whole? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Lisa Schmeiser, Moisés Chiullan, Erika Ensign, Steven Schapansky, David J. Loehr and James Thomson.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

      <description>"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" season one - It’s a cult show that could’ve hit the zeitgeist if it had just happened a few years later. From angsty vampire-human romances to a butt-kicking lead in a nice dress, the first season of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” delivers. We break down our favorite episodes, marvel at the show’s great casting, and appreciate the unlikely nature of a smart, character-driven teen series emerging from the wasteland that was The WB network in the late ’90s.

Batman University is in session, as we dive into “Batman: The Animated Series.” Lifelong Batman fan Tony Sindelar has provided us with a 10-episode watch list, which served as a refresher for our panel and an introduction for our host. What makes many people call this version of Batman the definitive one? How does a show that’s for kids end up being so strikingly adult? How is the character of this Batman not like recent movie depictions? We’ve got the answers. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Tony Sindelar, Shannon Sudderth, Dan Moren, David J.

      <description>"Rogue One" teaser trailer breakdown - The first teaser trailer for “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” has dropped, and so in the spirit of our “Force Awakens” teaser breakdown, we’re back to provide frame-by-frame analysis of all 90 seconds. This is the first in a new series of “Star Wars” anthology movies, this one set before and around 1977’s original film. How do you make a period piece about a fictional period? What’s Felicity Jones’s character all about? Why does Forrest Whitaker have a Darth Vader breathing harmonica? And why does Jason refer to all droids like they’re vacuum cleaners? For some questions there are no good answers. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with John Siracusa, Dan Moren and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We take a look at the two most (justly) maligned films starring the original “Star Trek” cast, “Star Trek: The Motion Picture” and “Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.” What do these two films have in common? Do they have any redeeming qualities? We watched them so you didn’t have to, because we need our pain! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Scott McNulty, David J.

      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/286/index.php</link>
      <description>"Hamilton", the musical - It’s taking the culture by storm, the biggest Broadway musical in years—and it’s about… the first U.S. secretary of the treasury, Alexander Hamilton? It seems unlikely, but nothing about the “Hamilton” story is likely. Lin-Manuel Miranda took the biography of a lesser-known early American figure and turned it into a story full of catchy songs and social commentary, including the rapid-fire hip-hop lyrics and the casting of non-white actors in most of the parts. Four of our “Hamilton”-mad panelists discuss the appeal of the show and why it works so incredibly well.  (This we’ve also launched an entire podcast devoted to “Hamilton”, so if you want to hear various panels discuss the show song by song, you may want to subscribe to that, too.)  Piano intro and outro music from Hamilton played by Christopher Breen.  &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Serenity Caldwell, Monty Ashley, David J. Loehr and Chip Sudderth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Ms. Marvel - In this edition of Comic Book Club, we discuss one of Marvel’s newest heroes, Kamala Khan, the star of G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona’s “Ms. Marvel.” She’s a Muslim from New Jersey, so in some ways she’s a very different kind of Marvel super hero, but she’s also a tortured teen trying to come to terms with her identity—so in other ways, she’s very much the model of a Marvel super hero. Plus: What are we reading? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Lisa Schmeiser, Shannon Sudderth, Aleen Simms and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"Doctor Who" series 9 wrap-up - Jump in your TARDIS, visit the Space Lions, and get prepared for a 24-year-long night! This week our panel takes on the recently-concluded ninth series of “Doctor Who.” How does this season measure up to the previous ones? Was the more character-focused conclusion a good change of pace? How did Missy, Ashildr, and Clara make things feel a bit different? And how well did the show handle the moment when Clara faced the raven? This episode is bigger on the inside. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Erika Ensign, Glenn Fleishman, Steven Schapansky and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this episode we praise the casting of Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac, and ponder how the diversity of the “Star Wars” universe has increased. Plus, did Luke hide something in all the droids? Why does Finn hold a lightsaber like a baseball bat? Why would one of the Weasley brothers become a fascist?

In this installment, we travel across the pond for a panel predominantly made up of residents of the UK. Why are there Scottish people in space? Who is the face of fresh young fascism? Where can we get red replacement arms? &lt;p&gt;Host Antony Johnston    with Liz Myles, James Thomson and Dan Moren.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>276: Don't Drink the Bacta Tea</title>
      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/276/index.php</link>
      <description>Star Wars Anticipation - With “The Force Awakens” only a week away, we pause to ponder why we’ve anticipated this film release for more than three years. What spoilers have we avoided? (This episode certainly contains none.) What does it mean that “Star Wars” is now an extended film franchise releasing new films annually? How many times are we going to see the film next weekend, and how will we find time to podcast about it? And perhaps most importantly, can any new “Star Wars” movie ever possibly hope to capture the excitement we felt when we discovered these films as children? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Serenity Caldwell, John Siracusa and Dan Moren.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Asimov's "Foundation" trilogy - We have seen tens of thousands of years into the future, and our best psychohistorians think the Galactic Empire will once again reign supreme… so long as there aren’t any surprise mutants or aliens. In this episode, we discuss Isaac Asimov’s classic “Foundation” trilogy. From the perspective of 2015, what still works, and what seems out of date?

      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/271/index.php</link>
      <description>Anticipating a new "Star Trek" series - This week came the announcement we’ve been waiting for: A new “Star Trek” series is in the works. But with the announcement came a bunch of interesting details (it’s going to be exclusive to CBS’ streaming service, it’s going to be produced by one of the co-writers of the J.J. Abrams “Star Trek” movies) and a lack of specifics (they’re still interviewing writers and didn’t announce even the most basic of premises). Our panel of Star Trek fans analyzes the interesting decisions CBS has made so far, tries to imagine how a “Star Trek” series from 2017 might differ from its predecessors, and discusses the importance of creating a series that can keep the franchise alive by appealing to a new generation of fans. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Scott McNulty, Brianna Wu, Dan Moren and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this corner, a robot astronaut named Frank! In that corner, a horde of invading aliens and their terrifying monster! In between, a bunch of stock footage, a very ’60s soundtrack, a bunch more stock footage, scientists riding scooters, the least sexy beach bikini scene ever, some military stock footage, and a party where everyone is wiggling their butts until the guy on the diving board is lasered to death. And did we mention the stock footage?   &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Glenn Fleishman, Steve Lutz, Monty Ashley and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"The Hunt for Red October" - It is a great day, comrades. We will sail our submarine to America, and watch one of their greatest thrillers, 1990’s “The Hunt for Red October.” Join us as we talk about how time has made the cold-war themes feel even more classic, ponder why the movie works despite plenty of signs suggesting that it shouldn’t, and… well, let’s just say we do a lot of Sean Connery impressions. This podcast contains one ping only, so don’t slip on your tea! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Philip Michaels, Dan Moren and Casey Liss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/264/index.php</link>

      <description>Super Mario Bros. - Our survey of terrible films continues with 1993’s “Super Mario Bros.”, which features surprisingly little of the characters, setting, or joy that one might attribute to the beloved video-game franchise. Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, and the directors of the original “Max Headroom” film collaborate on this dreadful tale about evolved dinosaurs, dystopian parallel-universe New Yorks, and a couple of plumbers named Mario, one of whom is also named Luigi. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Joe Rosensteel, Philip Michaels, Tony Sindelar, Monty Ashley, Steve Lutz and David J.

      <description>Vaughan and Alphona's "Runaways" - Our Comic Book Club reconvenes to discuss “Runaways,” the 2003-2004 comic series by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona. This is a Marvel Comic that’s also an original creation, and we’re tackling the 18 issues of the first volume, which form a self-contained story. How does the book alienate its teenage protagonists? Does the plot twist make sense? And why isn’t this a Marvel movie or TV show? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Shannon Sudderth, Lisa Schmeiser, Tony Sindelar and Dan Moren.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Comic-Con Special, Part 4 - In celebration of the four days of Comic-Con 2015, we present a four-day celebration of silly superhero debates! We’ve seeded 64 heroes into a tournament that’s designed to find the most incomparable superhero of them all. Or something like that. The advocates are sometimes passionate and sometime disinterested, but that’s okay, because the judges are completely capricious.  Today’s episode features the first round in the Latveria region, featuring the following match-ups:   Iron Man (1) vs. Iron Fist (16) Phoenix (8) vs. Gambit (9) Captain Marvel / Carol Danvers (5) vs. The Thing (12) Hawkeye / Clint Barton (4) vs. Big Barda (13) Rorschach (6) vs. Storm (11) Thor (3) vs. Invincible (14) Black Panther (7) vs. Nightcrawler (10) Wolverine (2) vs. Tigra (15)  &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell         with Steve Lutz, Philip Michaels, Tony Sindelar, Lisa Schmeiser, Dan Moren, Chip Sudderth, Andy Ihnatko and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <itunes:summary>Comic-Con Special, Part 3 - In celebration of the four days of Comic-Con 2015, we present a four-day celebration of silly superhero debates! We’ve seeded 64 heroes into a tournament that’s designed to find the most incomparable superhero of them all. Or something like that. The advocates are sometimes passionate and sometime disinterested, but that’s okay, because the judges are completely capricious.  Today’s episode features the first round in the Metropolis region, featuring the following match-ups:   Superman (1) vs. Iceman (16) Atom (8) vs. Falcon (9) Dr. Strange (5) vs. X-O Manowar (12) Tick (4) vs. Catwoman (13) Hellboy (6) vs. Invisible Woman (11) Flash - Barry Allen (3) vs. Question (14) Ghost Rider (7) vs. Blue Beetle - Jaime Reyes (10) Hulk (2) vs. Booster Gold (15)  &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell         with Chip Sudderth, Monty Ashley, Lisa Schmeiser, Tony Sindelar, Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, Steve Lutz and Philip Michaels.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

Our trek into films of questionable quality continues with John Boorman’s 1974 sci-fi epic “Zardoz,” starring Sean Connery in a red diaper and a floating stone head. Even the writer/director/producer can’t explain what happened, and neither can we—except maybe for Glenn. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Helene Wecker, Joe Rosensteel, Erika Ensign, Steve Lutz, David J.

One’s a biopic from the 1940s complete with a song, and the other is an appropriately gross 1970s comedy.

We begin our final battle with the “Star Wars” prequels with our take on “Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.” After a long string of opening statements, we take on the crawl and the first few scenes of the film. Why does a droid wheeze? Why are villains introduced off screen? Why is Christopher Lee wasted? What’s the deal with all the elevators? Why is Darth Vader a chump? Why is there even more boring political science? What happened to Natalie Portman, and why is she wearing beaded bedclothes while standing on balconies?

      <description>Underappreciated Hitchcock - Our Old Movie Club, featuring classic films many of us haven’t seen selected just for us by Philip Michaels, is back!  In this edition, we look at two underappreciated films of Alfred Hitchcock: 1943’s “Shadow of a Doubt” and 1948’s “Rope.” The former features Joseph Cotten shooting up through the ceiling of creepy, a battle of telepathy versus telegraphy, the special bond of people named Charlie, murder by soda, and an appearance by the Exposition Radio Network. The latter offers long unbroken scenes, drunk Farley Granger, a perfect murder perpetrated by Batman villains, and Jimmy Stewart as Columbo. Both films have Hitchcock in common, as well as Hume Cronyn… and murder! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Philip Michaels, Steve Lutz, Monty Ashley, Dan Moren, David J.

      <description>Rocket Surgery: "The Core" - Introducing a new recurring segment on The Incomparable that we call Rocket Surgery, in which we watch an unappreciated science fiction movie from the past and then talk about it.  For our first installment, we watched the 2003 film “The Core,” starring Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, and Bruce Greenwood. Yes, this is a movie about people riding a spaceship (of a sort) down into the core of the Earth in order to blow it up with nuclear bombs because reasons.  Our discussion topics include the science of birds, peaches as metaphors for the Earth, friendly whales, the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge, and the powers of computer hackers. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>233: Selective Amnesia</title>
      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/233/index.php</link>
      <description>Comic book continuity and events - We convene our Comic Book Club not to talk about a specific comic, but more generally the plight of the comic-book reader when it comes to events and continuity.

      <itunes:summary>Comic book continuity and events - We convene our Comic Book Club not to talk about a specific comic, but more generally the plight of the comic-book reader when it comes to events and continuity. Marvel and DC are both in the process of revisiting and changing their continuity via dramatic in-universe events. Is continuity worth the trouble? Are events fun, or soul-crushing? How do we feel about the old and new Marvel Secret Wars? Does the new all-woman Avengers team fill us with excitement or trepidation or both? And stick around after the show as we discuss Superman’s new power, the appeal of Harley Quinn, and even more comic nerdery! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Monty Ashley, Lisa Schmeiser and Andy Ihnatko.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

      <title>232: Learning to Love Heidi II</title>
      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/232/index.php</link>
      <description>"Groundhog Day" - Okay campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties because it’s coooold out there! We partake in our midwinter ritual of watching “Groundhog Day” over and over again, not because we have to, but because we want to. How does something that seems so generic on its surface unfold into one of the deepest and (dare we say it) most beloved films of all time? Plus, we cope with the Andie MacDowell problem, theorize about everything Phil did in Punxsutawney that the movie didn’t show us, and liken the entire thing to a video-game speed run. Let’s live here! &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Steve Lutz, Erika Ensign, Monty Ashley, Dan Frakes and Chip Sudderth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Alan Moore's "Promethea" - Comic Book Club returns, with a look at a work by legendary writer Alan Moore. This one’s “Promethea” (1999-2005), a strange mixture of Wonder Woman and mysticism and tarot cards and… well, there’s a lot. We discuss the amazing visuals, coloring, and lettering, and ponder the difference between appreciating a work of art and being entertained.  (Ideally you’d read Promethea Book 1 and Promethea Book 2 before listening, but the choice is yours.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Lisa Schmeiser, Monty Ashley, Chip Sudderth, Erika Ensign and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"The Last Policeman" - It’s your usual detective story, with a guy obsessed with a mystery, a femme fatale, and… an asteroid that’s about to kill most of the living things on the earth? That’s the premise for “The Last Policeman” by Ben Winters. We liked the book (and its two sequels) quite a lot, though that comes with a big caveat based on what your definition of “fun” is, and apparently if you’re a soulless monster or not. Plus: What are we reading? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Erika Ensign, Lisa Schmeiser and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"The Iron Giant." - In the long tradition of big, giant robots came 1999’s “The Iron Giant,” the film Brad Bird made before he made “The Incredibles.” It was kind of a flop in its initial release, but this animated feature has become rightfully recognized as a classic.

Does the franchise aspect of these films help or hurt? Are the action scenes more interesting than the urban disasters featured in most recent superhero movies?

Also, we reveal the Hydra secret handshake. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with Tony Sindelar, Dan Moren, Guy English, Moisés Chiullan and Rene Ritchie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"WarGames." - Warm up your modem and turn your nuclear-launch key—it’s time to play Global Thermonuclear War! We discuss “WarGames,” the 1983 John Badham film starring Matthew Broderick, Dabney Coleman, and Ally Sheedy. Is this the ultimate film for computer nerds like us? How do the film’s Cold War themes contrast with its anti-technology themes? Can a computer make moral decisions? Why is there so much nerd shaming and sexism? And why do they let tour buses into the heart of America’s nuclear command? So many questions, Professor Falken, and so few remote-controlled pterodactyls. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Greg Knauss, John Siracusa, Andy Ihnatko and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones." (Part 1 of 2.) - Against the advice of our doctors, we’re back with more prequels. This time it’s “Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones.” With three different opening statements, our podcast is about as bureaucratic as the Imperial Senate. We also discuss R2’s incompetence as a security system, ponder Anakin’s puzzling pick-up lines (and haircut), sympathize with the boring job of the Jedi, and question the plight of the Fett family and the clone troopers. (Part 1 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell      with John Siracusa, Steve Lutz, Serenity Caldwell, Dan Moren and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Casting new actors in iconic parts. - Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, but will he always be? We discuss the interesting problem of replacing the face of your franchise, whether it’s Doctor Who or James Bond or Captain Kirk or Batman or Superman. Fortunately, we leave plenty of time for digressions into old TV shows (including “Three’s Company,” “Bewitched,” and “Magnum P.I.”) and anger the internet’s foremost Robocopians. Spoiler: In the end, Hollywood ruins everything. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Jason Brightman, Andy Ihnatko, Erika Ensign and David J. Loehr.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"The Lies of Locke Lamora" and "Ancillary Justice." - Our book club returns with discussion of two books! First we talk Scott Lynch’s “The Lies of Locke Lamora,” a fantasy book about a gang of thieves that are even outlaws to other thieves (spoiler horn at 12:00). Then it’s Ann Leckie’s “Ancillary Justice,” a space opera about AIs and ships and empires and corpse soldiers that brings Iain M. Banks to mind (starts at 28:48, spoilers at 33:22). Confusingly long prologues! Fun with gendered pronouns! Questionable burrito metaphors! Plus: What are we reading (starts at 68:13)? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Scott McNulty and Monty Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Separating authors from their art, and series that have disappointed us. - Awful people can make great art. Nice people can write bad books. Can you separate the creator from the art? We struggle with Orson Scott Card and his (rightfully) classic novel “Ender’s Game” and go on to list other writers and series who we’ve hand to break up with. To make things not entirely disappointing, we also talk about authors and series that have never let us down. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Lisa Schmeiser, Scott McNulty, Dan Moren and David J.

      <description>Video games "Brothers" and "Gone Home." - In this double-length episode we talk about two video games even non-gamers like Jason can enjoy, “Gone Home” and “Brothers.” We ponder what makes a game challenging, and if a game must be challenging to be good. John likes both games, but has a list of grievances. All disagreements will be settled with a duel of ’80s mixtapes at dawn!

How do Pegg and Wright so deftly handle different genres? How are these movies like the Commedia dell’arte? Why do Jason and Jeff want to punch Nick Frost, then hug him?

      <title>157: Bros and Arrows</title>
      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/157/index.php</link>
      <description>"Hawkeye" by Fraction and Aja. - An entire comic book about Hawkeye, the lesser Marvel superhero with a bow and arrow? Okay… this looks bad. But seriously, bro, this is one of the very best comics being published today. We cover the first two trade-paperback editions of Fraction and Aja’s series, including Lucky the Pizza Dog, 50 Shades of Purple, and how hooking up a laserdisc player is similar to defusing a bomb. Hop on board and join us—we’re great at boats. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, Lisa Schmeiser, Merlin Mann and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We’re here to talk about three very different time-travel movies: “12 Monkeys,” “Looper,” and “Primer.” Is “Crazy Brad Pitt” a thing?

We read your emails, your iTunes reviews, and your tweets, and announce a contest that will let one lucky listener choose the topic of a future episode. Are we too critical or not critical enough? Do we disagree too much or not enough?

      <description>The original "Star Trek." (Part 2 of 2.) - Disconnect the intelligent computer that runs your entire planetary society, because it’s time for the second half of our discussion of the original “Star Trek.” What do today’s kids think of this nearly 50-year-old show? We ponder the gender politics of splitting Captain Kirk (and a little dog in a weird costume) into good and evil halves. And what about the low standards of the Enterprise’s Engineering department? Please listen: It will only take 71 of your Earth minutes! (Part 2 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Scott McNulty, Steve Lutz and Tony Sindelar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"The Rook" by Daniel O'Malley. - Cut off your thumb and send it to a friend just to see what grows! In this episode of our Book Club, we talk about Daniel O’Malley’s modern supernatural fantasy novel, “The Rook.” (We liked it a lot!) It’s sort of about a supernatural version of Britain’s MI-5, written by an American-educated Australian civil servant. Also: What are Scott, Dan, and Jason reading? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Dan Moren and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We tackle Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, from its epic length to the perils of adapting such rich source material. Plus a spotter’s guide to differentiating between Dwarfy, Elfy, Beardy, and Hobbits One through Four. And Glenn proves that he knows Elvish.

      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/119/index.php</link>
      <description>"The Amazing Spider-Man." - With great power comes the responsibility to book great guests. And so when it came time to discuss “The Amazing Spider-Man” and Spidey in general, Jason turned to reknowned spider-fans Andy Ihnatko and Dan Benjamin. We discuss how the Spidey in the new movie is a different sort of guilt-trip superhero. Dan explains why you can’t actually kill a spider. Andy previews his new comic book, The Indigestible Spider-Man. We touch on the changes in Ultimate Spider-Man and speculate about the soon-to-arrive Amazing Spider-Man #700. Jason sings two different Spidey theme songs and does his J. Jonah Jameson impression. This giant-sized episode is more Spidey than you can shake a web at. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Andy Ihnatko and Dan Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Soon to be a major motion picture you probably shouldn’t see, David Mitchell’s 2004 novel “Cloud Atlas” is in our sights. This novel consists of six separate stories set in different genres and timeframes from the 1850s to a post-apocalyptic future, and yet they’re all interlinked. Somehow. It’s fun, weird, and challenging, but what does it all mean?

      <title>107: A Little Obsessed With Kirk</title>
      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/107/index.php</link>
      <description>"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" - We take on one of our favorite movies, “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” while also acknowledging the flaws that make it all the more lovable. Topics include: How Genesis is the galaxy’s worst Kickstarter project; Why it’s always important to count the planets, especially at Ceti Alpha; The size of the Botany Bay library and why it makes Khan so mad at Kirk; Why Scott’s email is more secure than the Reliant; The real name of Khan’s right-hand man; and how Spock’s death solves Kirk’s mid-life crisis. Also, we scientifically prove that “Wrath of Khan” is better than Star Wars. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Scott McNulty, Steve Lutz and Michael Gartenberg.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/93/index.php</link>
      <description>"Ship Breaker" and "The Drowned Cities" - Our book club takes a dive into the world of Paolo Bacigalupi, covering his award-winning novel “Ship Breaker” as well as its recently-released follow-up, “The Drowned Cities.” These books are apparently considered YA (or Young Adult) fiction, leading us to discuss what that label means, if anything. We also talk about Bacigalupi’s particular brand of eco-apocalypse, his use of science fiction to make us reconsider what’s going on today in the world, and how to pronounce his name. And of course, we coin a new word: it’s half monster, half mentor, all Scott McNulty. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell   with Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"The Avengers" - Avengers assemble! We discuss Joss Whedon’s Marvel movie, which has been a hit with audiences and critics. But some members of our panel don’t agree. How much do expectations factor in to one’s enjoyment of a movie? Has the bar for summer action blockbusters been set too low by the likes of “Transformers 2”? Should every action-adventure movie aspire to be something more? Why is this the first time that the Hulk has been portrayed properly in a film? Grab your cosmic cubes and prepare for 90 minutes of movie-smashing discussion. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Andy Ihnatko, Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Ben Boychuk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s time for us to discuss the second season of the BBC’s “Sherlock,” starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. We walk through all three movie-length episodes, starting with the exemplary “Scandal in Belgravia,” moving on to the not-so-exemplary “Hounds of Baskerville,” and concluding with the mind-blowing “Reichenbach Fall.” &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, Greg Knauss and John Siracusa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"Return of the Jedi" (part 2) - We wrap up our six-part series on the classic “Star Wars” movies with the climactic final half of “Return of the Jedi.” We discuss how the Empire is ahead of the rebels every step of the way, question Luke’s choice of forest camouflage, and explain why Ewoks are better unsubtitled. Also, how is Luke’s journey to being a Jedi not like what you see in most action movies? Who is more heroic in the end, Luke or Vader? Why does the Emperor wait so long to show us his lightning fingers? Why are rebel ships equipped with fireworks? And is Endor the name of the moon, or the name of the planet the moon is orbiting, or both? &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with Dan Moren, John Siracusa and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It’s the end of the world! And since our eyeglasses are intact, we have time enough at last, to read. We discuss Maureen McHugh’s “After the Apocalypse” short-story collection, Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road,” and other apocalypse tales we have known. Do zombies have their own David Attenborough, leading expeditions into Cleveland? Why should you be afraid if heavy snowfall combines with the appearance of strange invisible magic ghost sex-dragon monsters? And why does John Siracusa plan to ride out the apocalypse in style? We ask several of these questions, but you’ll have to listen to see if we ever answer any of them. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell    with John Siracusa, Lisa Schmeiser and Scott McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We close the books on the first Incomparable Film Festival with this special follow-up episode. We provide the show times for each day of the festival, share your feedback, and reveal the results of your vote for the best slate of films. We also check in with two panelists who couldn’t make the original draft, one of whom has a bone to pick with John Siracusa. The other one instead tells a heartwarming tale of projectile vomiting. (Part 3 of 2.) &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell       with Dan Moren, Greg Knauss, Lex Friedman, Scott McNulty, Serenity Caldwell and Steve Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Our Comic Book Club gets in a romantic mood with a discussion of comic-book romances—the (very) few that have stood the test of time and the (very) many that have been thwarted by clones, telepaths, cloned telepaths, and—worst of all—Satan’s Annulment.

      <description>Step through your time portal, buy some cheap 1950s hamburger, and prepare for our discussion of Stephen King’s new novel 11/22/63. How does a 21st century man react to the racism and sexism of the south in the mid-20th century? Would the world have been a better place if Kennedy hadn’t been assassinated? Is Canada really eyeing the state of Maine anxiously? Like the book, we have some—but not all—of the answers. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Lisa Schmeiser and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>"The Wise Man's Fear" - Is Patrick Rothfuss’s “The Wise Man’s Fear” a rich fantasy novel about storytelling and myth-making, or is it a collection of good story elements scattered across an overlong plot? Could it be both? Ninjas! Off-camera shipwrecks! Board games! Sexism! Off-camera courtroom drama! Discursions within digressions within framing sequences! Join us as we discuss yet another 1000-page fantasy novel, the sequel to “The Name of the Wind.” &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell     with Dan Moren, John Siracusa, Scott McNulty and Serenity Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <itunes:summary>Strap on your jet pack and locate your pet monkey! Our Comic Book Club reconvenes to discuss works by writer Brian K. Vaughan, who excels at the high-concept premise. In the spotlight: “Runaways,” “Y: The Last Man,” and “Ex Machina.” With plenty of digressions along the way, about feminism, parenting, sexism, and (once again) how hard it is to write an ending. &lt;p&gt;Host Jason Snell  with Lisa Schmeiser.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

We praise the jump to hyperspace, explain why TIE fighter pilots wear black, ponder how Han and Leia somehow turn up in an Aaron Sorkin scene, reveal why there is no Space OSHA, comment on Ben Kenobi’s old man slippers and incomparable pseudonym, and expose the rebellion so rich it can have its own university and mint its own medals.
